I hate her illness."}

{"prompt": "Explanation from Dr. Fred Richmond in Psycho (final scene):", "completion": "Dr. Fred Richmond: Like I said... the mother... Now to understand it the way I understood it, hearing it from the mother... that is, from the mother half of Norman's mind... you have to go back ten years, to the time when Norman murdered his mother and her lover. Now he was already dangerously disturbed, had been ever since his father died. His mother was a clinging, demanding woman, and for years the two of them lived as if there was no one else in the world. Then she met a man... and it seemed to Norman that she 'threw him over' for this man. Now that pushed him over the line and he killed them both. Matricide is probably the most unbearable crime of all... most unbearable to the son who commits it. So he had to erase the crime, at least in his own mind. He stole her corpse. A weighted coffin was buried. He hid the body in the fruit cellar. Even treated it to keep it as well as it would keep. And that still wasn't enough. She was there! But she was a corpse. So he began to think and speak for her, give her half his life, so to speak. At times he could be both personalities, carry on conversations. At other times, the mother half took over completely. Now he was never all Norman, but he was often only mother. And because he was so pathologically jealous of her, he assumed that she was jealous of him. Therefore, if he felt a strong attraction to any other woman, the mother side of him would go wild. When he met your sister, he was touched by her... aroused by her. He wanted her. That set off the 'jealous mother' and 'mother killed the girl'! Now after the murder, Norman returned as if from a deep sleep. And like a dutiful son, covered up all traces of the crime he was convinced his mother had committed!"}

{"prompt": "Scene from Psycho explaining Norman Bates' condition:", "completion": "Officer: He's a transvestite! Dr. Fred Richmond: Ah, not exactly. A man who dresses in women's clothing in order to achieve a sexual change, or satisfaction, is a transvestite. But in Norman's case, he was simply doing everything possible to keep alive the illusion of his mother being alive. And when reality came too close, when danger or desire threatened that illusion - he dressed up, even to a cheap wig he bought. He'd walk about the house, sit in her chair, speak in her voice. He tried to be his mother! And, uh... now he is. Dr. Fred Richmond: Now, that's what I meant when I said I got the story from the mother. You see, when the mind houses two personalities, there's always a conflict, a battle. In Norman's case, the battle is over... and the dominant personality has won. Officer: And the forty thousand dollars? Who got that? Dr. Fred Richmond: The swamp. These were crimes of passion, not profit. Officer: He feels a chill. Can I bring him this blanket?

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Director Sir Alfred Hitchcock was so pleased with the score written by Bernard Herrmann that he doubled the composer's salary to $34,501. Hitchcock later said, 'Thirty-three percent of the effect of Psycho was due to the music.' Ironically, he was originally adamant that there should be no music in the shower scene but he was persuaded by his wife to give it a try. The screeching violins and dire strings (which would inspire the music for Jaws (1975)) ended up selling the scene and driving theatrical audiences beyond anything they had ever experienced."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Director Sir Alfred Hitchcock bought the rights to the novel anonymously from Robert Bloch for only $9,000. He then bought up as many copies of the novel as he could in order to keep the ending a secret."}

They said in interviews they would rather be stereotyped and be remembered forever for this classic movie than not be remembered at all."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Paramount Pictures gave Sir Alfred Hitchcock a very small budget with which to work, because of their distaste with the source material. They also deferred most of the box-office take to Hitchcock, thinking the movie would fail. When it became a sleeper hit, Hitchcock made a fortune."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Sir Alfred Hitchcock wanted to make this movie so much that he deferred his standard $250,000 salary in lieu of 60% of the movie's gross. Paramount Pictures, believing that the movie would do poorly at the box office, agreed. His personal earnings from the movie exceeded $15 million. Adjusted for inflation, that amount would be equivalent to over $156 million in 2024 dollars."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "When Norman first realizes there has been a murder, he shouts, 'Mother! Oh God! God! Blood! Blood!' Sir Alfred Hitchcock had the bass frequencies removed from Anthony Perkins' voice to make him sound more like a frightened teenager."}

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "In order to implicate viewers as fellow voyeurs, Sir Alfred Hitchcock used a 50 mm lens on his 35 mm camera. This gives the closest approximation to the human vision. In the scenes where Norman is spying on Marion, this effect is felt."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "The reason Sir Alfred Hitchcock cameos so early in the movie was because he knew people would be looking out for him, and he didn't want to divert their attention away from the plot."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "In the opening scene, Marion Crane is wearing a white bra and slip before dressing in an all white outfit complete with a white handbag. Sir Alfred Hitchcock made that wardrobe choice to establish Marion as being good and pure. After Marion has stolen the money from her boss, the following scene shows her packing her belongings while semi dressed in a black bra and slip. She dresses in a darker outfit and has changed from a white handbag to black. The change from an all white wardrobe to black is to demonstrate that Marion has gone from angelic to evil."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "For a shot looking up into the water stream of the shower head, Sir Alfred Hitchcock had a six-foot-diameter shower head made up and blocked the central jets so that the water sprayed in a cone past the camera lens, without any water spraying directly at it."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "To ensure the people were in the theaters at the start of this movie (rather than walking in part way through) the studio provided a record to play in the foyer of the theaters. The album featured background music, occasionally interrupted by a voice saying 'Ten minutes to Psycho time', 'Five minutes to Psycho time', and so on."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "One of the reasons Sir Alfred Hitchcock shot the movie in black-and-white was he thought it would be too gory in color. But the main reason was that he wanted to make the movie as inexpensively as possible (under one million dollars). He also wondered if so many bad, inexpensively made, black-and-white 'B' movies did so well at the box-office, what would happen if a really good, inexpensively made, black-and-white movie was made."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Sir Alfred Hitchcock used Bosco chocolate syrup instead of blood, because it showed up better on camera."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Before Psycho (1960), movie theaters would play shows on rotation all day long. People would frequently come in the middle of one and stay till the middle of the next showing; leaving when they came in. But Hitchcock made all the movie theater owners sign a contract that they would not let anyone in until the start of the film. Once they were late; they would not be let in until the next showing. This started formalizing the whole process of mandatory seating times at theaters which continues until today."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Although Norman Bates typecasted Anthony Perkins, he said he still would have taken the role, even if he knew the character would dog his career."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "The movie in large part was made because Sir Alfred Hitchcock was fed up with the big-budget, star-studded movies he had recently been making and wanted to experiment with the more efficient, sparser style of television filmmaking. He ultimately used a crew consisting mostly of television veterans and hired actors and actresses less well-known than those he usually used. Specifically, Vertigo (1958), which was later hailed as a masterpiece, was considered a bloated, over-budgeted misfire. And while North by Northwest (1959) was hailed as a masterpiece and was a hit, it was a huge production, and it was also very time-consuming and expensive. So Hitchcock decided to scale things back for his next movie. Also, during the same period, his rival, French new wave and noir film director Henri-Georges Clouzot, hit the bullseye and created a critical box office sensation with the classic Diabolique (1955). All the critics said Clouzot had out-Hitchcocked Hitchcock, and this presented a confrontation which Hitchcock could not turn down. Diabolique was a small scale, gritty, black and white independent movie, so Hitchcock decided to out-Diabolique Diabolique and directed his own small scale, gritty black and white project - that was Psycho."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Although Janet Leigh was not bothered by the filming of the famous shower scene (though she used a body double), seeing it on film profoundly moved her. She later remarked that it made her realize how vulnerable a woman was in a shower. To the end of her life, she always took baths."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "The shot of Arbogast falling backward down the stairs was a process shot of Martin Balsam sitting stationary and waving his arms, as if losing his balance, in front of a screen projecting a previously filmed dolly shot moving down the stairs."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Janet Leigh received threatening letters after this movie's release, detailing what they would like to do to Marion Crane. One was so grotesque, she passed it on to the F.B.I. The culprits were discovered, and the F.B.I. said she should notify them again if she ever received any more letters."}

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "The novel upon which this movie was based was inspired by the true story of Ed Gein, a serial killer who was also the inspiration for Deranged (1974), The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), and The Silence of the Lambs (1991)."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "This movie only cost $800,000 to make, and earned more than $40 million. Sir Alfred Hitchcock used the crew from his television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955) to save time and money. In 1962, he exchanged the rights to the movie and his television series for a huge block of MCA's stock, becoming its third-largest stockholder."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "The sound that the knife makes penetrating the flesh is actually the sound of a knife stabbing a casaba melon."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh were allowed to improvise their roles. For example, Norman's habit of munching on candy corn."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "The amount of cash Marion stole, $40,000 in 1960 would be equivalent to approximately $352,000 in 2020. The $700 difference she paid when trading in her car, and getting another one, would be equivalent to about $6,100."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "At the time of the film's production, because of an FCC ruling, any references to toilets could not be presented in both film and television. To add realism to the story, Joseph Stefano was adamant about seeing a toilet on-screen, and he wanted to see it flush. Sir Alfred Hitchcock told him he had to 'make it so' through his writing if he wanted to see it. Stefano wrote the scene in which Marion adds up the money, then flushes the paper down the toilet specifically so the flushing was integral to the scene, and therefore irremovable. This was the first American (and possibly the first fictional) movie ever to show a toilet flushing on-screen."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "In Robert Bloch's novel, Norman Bates is short, fat, middle-aged and very unlikable. It was Sir Alfred Hitchcock who decided to present him as young, handsome, and sympathetic. Norman is also more of a main character in the novel. The story opens with Norman and Mother fighting rather than following Marion from the start."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "In the novel, the character of 'Marion' was 'Mary' Crane. The name was changed because the studio legal department found that two real people named Mary Crane lived in Phoenix, Arizona."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Sir Alfred Hitchcock even had a canvas chair with 'Mrs. Bates' written on the back prominently placed and displayed on the set throughout shooting. This further added to the enigma surrounding who was the actress playing Mrs. Bates."}

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Janet Leigh only had three weeks to work on the movie and spent the whole of one of those weeks filming the shower sequence."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "The Bates house was largely modeled on the 1925 oil painting 'House by the Railroad' by American artist Edward Hopper. It was the first painting acquired by New York's Museum of Modern Art, in 1930. The architectural details, viewpoint, and austere sky are almost identical to the house in the movie."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "In his famous interviews with Sir Alfred Hitchcock, François Truffaut, who was a fan of the movie, commented that the scenes with the sheriff were a letdown. Hitchcock replied: 'The sheriff's intervention comes under the heading of what we have discussed many times before: \"Why don't they go to the police?\". I've always replied: \"They don't go to the police because it's dull.\" Here is a perfect example of what happens when they go to the police'."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "When she was auditioned for the job of Janet Leigh's body double in Psycho's iconic shower scene, model, dancer, and Playboy covergirl Marli Renfro said she had to strip naked for Alfred Hitchcock. After he examined her every curve, he took her to Leigh's trailer where she had to drop her robe again while Leigh reviewed her body. Renfro was a dedicated nudist and a professional stripper, so she had no issue being naked in front of people. After she was cast, she said she spent hours a day for a week naked on set in front of Hitchcock and a mostly male crew as they shot from every angle. At one point, Hitchcock attached a measuring tape to the lens of the camera, walked over and put the point of it on her left nipple to make sure her breast will be out of focus. But she said he was an absolute gentleman and went out of his way to make her feel comfortable."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "In an interview on The Dick Cavett Show (1968), Sir Alfred Hitchcock said of the shower scene, 'everything was so rapid that there were seventy-eight separate pieces of film in forty-five seconds.'"}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Shooting wrapped February 1, 1960, nine days over schedule. A rough cut was finished by April, at which point, Sir Alfred Hitchcock was convinced his 'experiment' had failed. He was ready to cut the movie down to a television episode, but handed it to Bernard Herrmann to score. After he saw the completed movie with the music, he was very pleased."}

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "The movie's line 'A boy's best friend is his mother.' was voted as the #56 movie quote by the American Film Institute (out of 100)."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "According to Janet Leigh, the wardrobe worn by her character Marion Crane was not custom made for her, but rather purchased 'off the rack' from ordinary clothing stores. Sir Alfred Hitchcock wanted women viewers to identify with the character by having her wear clothes that an ordinary secretary could afford, and thus add to the mystique of realism."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Sir Alfred Hitchcock was initially disappointed with the movie. He even disliked the shower scene and believed the movie would end up on a low budget drive-in double-bill. According to Bernard Herrmann, Hitchcock thought of editing it down for broadcast on his television show. Hitchcock did not conceive of music for the shower scene, but Herrmann did it anyway. After seeing the movie with its score, including the shower sequence, he realized that the movie would work."}

I will only direct you if A: you attempt to take more than your share of the pie, B: you don't take enough, or C: if you are having trouble motivating the necessary timed movement.'"}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "When Sir Alfred Hitchcock was off due to illness, the crew shot the sequence of Arbogast inside the house going up the stairs. When Hitchcock saw the footage, he complimented those responsible but said the sequence had to be reshot. Their version made it appear as if Arbogast was going up the stairs to commit a murder. Hitchcock reshot the sequence."}

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Sir Alfred Hitchcock hated the infamous psychiatrist explanation scene done by Dr. Fred Richman (Simon Oakland) at the end of the movie. He felt the scene was boring, and the movie came to a grinding halt at that point. The scene has also been ripped to shreds by critics over the years as the worst scene in the movie, and one of Hitchcock's worst scenes ever. Hitchcock and viewers felt the scene was unnecessary, overly obvious, and too talky, slowing down the action and suspense of the rest of the movie. But there was strong pressure from the studios and powers-that-be that funded and distributed the movie to relieve the pressure from earlier scenes, and also to explain the action to less insightful audience members who might be confused by the big reveal at the ending, so the scene was kept in."}

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "As part of publicity campaign prior to release of this movie, Sir Alfred Hitchcock said: 'It has been rumored that Psycho is so terrifying that it will scare some people speechless.

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Features Janet Leigh's only Oscar nominated performance."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Screenwriter Joseph Stefano and director Sir Alfred Hitchcock deliberately layered-in certain risqué elements as a ruse to divert the censors from more crucial concerns, like the action that takes place in the bedroom in the beginning and the shower murder. The censors reviewed the script and censored the 'unimportant' extra material and Hitchcock managed to sneak in his 'important' material."}

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Sir Alfred Hitchcock ran a deliciously droll and terse radio ad in the summer of 1960. In an era when sponsors used 'Brand X' to describe their competitors' products, Hitchcock's voice said he wanted to compare his new movie with 'Brand X.' Then, the sound of a horse neighing and horse clippity-clop sounds. Hitchcock's voice said simply 'Brand X is a western.' 'Now for my picture,' followed by a loud scream. End of commercial."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "The car dealership in the movie was actually Harry Maher's used car lot near Universal Studios.

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Multiple characters in Halloween (1978) are inspired by this movie. Jamie Lee Curtis was cast as the heroine in this movie, based on the casting of her mother, Janet Leigh, in Psycho. Dr. Sam Loomis is directly named after John Gavin's character, the boyfriend to Marion in this movie. The name of Marion Chambers, the nurse in Halloween, is inspired by Marion and Judge Chambers. Billy Loomis, the killer from Scream (1996), was also inspired by Sam Loomis in Psycho. Also, Bates High School in Carrie (1976) is inspired by Norman Bates in Psycho."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Bernard Herrmann related how the shots of Marion driving away after taking the money looked very ordinary. Sir Alfred Hitchcock thought of having the soundtrack convey anxious voices in her head to add to the action and tension. Herrmann noted, however, that it still didn't work until he suggested bringing back the main title music. All in all, Hitchcock was delighted with Herrmann's very significant contribution to this movie, giving the composer an unusual amount of credit (for Hitchcock) and stating openly that 'Thirty-three percent of the effect of Psycho was due to the music.'"}

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Among the major promotional items for this movie was a lengthy coming attractions trailer (filmed in several languages) of Sir Alfred Hitchcock taking the audience on a seemingly lighthearted tour of the house and motel. At the end, Hitchcock pulls open a shower curtain to reveal a close-up of a woman screaming. The actress is not Janet Leigh, but Vera Miles wearing a wig similar to Miss Leigh's hairstyle. The logo 'Psycho' simultaneously comes onto the screen and cleverly covers Miss Miles' eyes so that the switch is not easily discernible."}

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "During pre-production, Sir Alfred Hitchcock said to the press that he was considering Helen Hayes for the part of Mother. This was obviously a ruse, but several actresses wrote to Hitchcock requesting auditions."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "In Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998), Janet Leigh drove a 1950s car similar to Marion Crane's, which, when revealed, part of the Psycho theme is played. Director John Carpenter was inspired by Psycho when making Halloween (1978) and was quite excited when Leigh's daughter Jamie Lee Curtis auditioned and was cast. Leigh played Curtis' secretary. Coincidentally (or perhaps NOT so coincidentally), Leigh's character in H20 is named 'Norma.'"}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "This movie was first scheduled to air on U.S. network television in the fall of 1966. Just before it would have aired, however, Valerie Percy, the daughter of U.S. Senate candidate Charles Percy (U.S. Senator,1967-1985), was stabbed to death, apparently by an intruder in their family's home in Highland Park, Illinois; as of 2023, the murder remains unsolved. It was deemed prudent, under the circumstances, to postpone the scheduled airing. Ultimately, this movie was not shown on U.S. network television until 1970, following a highly successful theatrical re-release in 1969. At that time, Universal Pictures released it on the syndication market, where it quickly became a popular staple on local late-night horror movie showings."}

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "When Marion is having a conversation with Norman in his parlor, Norman says in reference to his mother: 'She had to raise me all by herself after my father died.

From then on, he was raised by his mother."}

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "One of the reasons why Sir Alfred Hitchcock wanted to make this movie in black-and-white is because Hitchcock loved the French horror movie Diabolique (1955), which was made in black-and-white. Diabolique was based on Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac's novel 'Celle qui n'était plus' (She Who Was No More). Hitchcock attempted to buy the rights to this novel in 1950s. But Director Henri-Georges Clouzot bought the movie rights to the original novel. Clouzot reportedly beat Hitchcock by only a matter of a few hours."}

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "The look of the tall vertical mansion on the hill contrasted with the low, long motel was a deliberate composition choice. Yet Sir Alfred Hitchcock said it wasn't his intention to create a mysterious atmosphere with the big Gothic house, but to re-create the kind of older architecture that existed in the Northern California setting of the story."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "The first scene to be shot was of Marion getting pulled over by the cop. This was filmed on Golden State Highway (CA 99)."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Tony Curtis, Janet Leigh's husband at the time, claimed in his autobiography that the film's success, and the fact that all anyone wanted to talk to her about was the shower scene, drove his wife to drink, which eventually led to her breakdown and their divorce."}

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "'Psycho' is considered emblematic for the erosion of the Hays Code's censorship standards during the 1960s. Sam Loomis and Marion Crane were depicted as lovers sharing the same bed, with Marion wearing a bra in their moments of intimacy.

One of the former owners of one of the hotels is a horror movie buff, and puts on costume parties in his retirement. Being a fan of horror movies, he renamed his motel 'Bates Motel.' In April 2012, the hotel was torn down, but the hotel sign is still intact."}

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "This movie was given an R rating by the MPAA in 1984 even though the movie was released in 1960. The MPAA ratings system wasn't created until 1968, and, from time to time, they rerate older movies."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Except for some shots filmed on backroads in Southern California (the scenes of Marion fleeing Phoenix), this movie was filmed on the backlot at Universal Studios.

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "In later interviews, Sir Alfred Hitchcock and Janet Leigh categorically stated that it was her body in the shower scene, but it wasn't. The body belonged to a model called Marli Renfro. When you can't see Leigh's face in the shots, you're looking at her body double. She only made $500 for filming what would become one of the most iconic movie scenes ever. A Dallas-born stripper who worked in Las Vegas, Renfro was one of the first Playboy Bunnies. Apart from Psycho, she only appeared in one other film: Francis Ford Coppola's 1962 soft-porn comedy-western Tonight for Sure (1962)."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Norman says that their business dropped away 'when the highway was moved.'

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Sir Alfred Hitchcock had previously cast Vera Miles in The Wrong Man (1956). He wanted to cast her in Vertigo (1958), but she had to turn it down due to pregnancy. Miles was not happy making this movie, and felt that Hitchcock was punishing her by giving her an unflattering wardrobe that made her look matronly, never mind that it was designed by the famous Hollywood designer Edith Head. For her work, Miles received $100,700 per week."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "During filming, this movie was referred to as 'Production 9401' or 'Wimpy'. The latter name came from Second Unit Cameraman Rex Wimpy, who appeared on clapboards and production sheets, and some on-the-set stills for this movie."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Due to the censorship rules of the Hays Code, Marion Crane's murder scene was less violent than its counterpart in the novel.

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "A scene of the film cryptically depicts Lila Crane looking through a book with a blank cover.

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "The film takes place in December 1959."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "Sir Alfred Hitchcock always preferred to film indoors on a soundstage, and only the distant shots of the Bates Mansion were shot outside on the backlot. To accomplish this, and allow for an exterior to interior dolly shot, a second, duplicate, mansion exterior consisting only of the front porch was constructed on the soundstage and the cut from exterior, backlot, set to interior soundstage can clearly be seen as Lila approaches, visible in the difference in the lighting when the camera cuts from her back to the porch and front door once she gets close."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "For Marion's driving scenes, to get her proper actions and facial expressions, Alfred Hitchcock articulated to Janet Leigh what she was doing and thinking at every point in her flight from justice. Later on, cutaway views of the windshield and rear view mirror, road sounds, and voice overs from the other actors, were cut into the film, establishing these stimuli for the audience."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "The final shot in the famous shower scene depicted an extreme close-up on Marion Crane's unblinking eye. The scene was difficult for actress Janet Leigh. Water from the shower kept splashing in her eyes, causing involuntary blinking. The scene was also difficult for the cameraman, who had been asked to manually focus the camera while moving it. Alfred Hitchcock had to do several retakes of the scene."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "The camera used to shoot Norman's point of view as he watched Marion undress through the peephole required a circular mask on the lens."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "\"Mother\", or Norma Bates, is played by several actors and actresses in the movie, including Anthony Perkins. Several people contributed to her shrieking harpy hag voice, and there was a deliberate attempt to age her up, make her older, since Sir Alfred Hitchcock wanted this to be an apocryphal voice of Norman's own conscience and inner demons. Realistically, Norma Bates would be about fifty, since Norman in the movie is only about twenty-six, but you can hear from the voice of the actors and actresses playing her that she is supposed to be a sexagenarian, which is possible if she gave birth to Norman when she was in her mid to late thirties."}
{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "The censorship board which examined \"Psycho\" protested the depiction of intimacy between Sam Loomis and Marion Crane, an unmarried couple. Alfred Hitchcock offered to re-shoot the scenes, with the presence of censors on the film set to examine the scenes first-hand.

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "In the film, the Bates main residence was based on the painting \"House by the Railroad\" (1925) by Edward Hopper.

{"prompt": "Trivia from Psycho:", "completion": "The film was budgeted so well that total production costs came to just less than $807,000 at the time. By comparison, 1.5 hours (3 episodes) of the Hitchcock half-hour television show of the day cost $387,000, just less than half of what the film cost."}
